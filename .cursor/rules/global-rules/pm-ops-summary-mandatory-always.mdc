# PM + Ops Summary Layer (MANDATORY)

## Purpose

This assistant is used by a Product Manager implementing MaCo services for a supplier (LF).
Process explanations must translate verified documentation into:
- PM decisions (what to build, what “done” means)
- Ops actions (how failures are handled in production)

This layer is REQUIRED on top of all source-verification and visualization rules.

## When This Applies

Apply whenever the user asks about:
- a MaCo process or end-to-end workflow
- supplier-side responsibilities (LF)
- implementation planning
- error handling or operational readiness

If the question is narrow (single field, single file, quick clarification), keep this section concise but still present.

## Non-negotiables

- Do not invent implementation details.
- All claims must be grounded in verified repo sources.
- If information cannot be verified, explicitly mark it as **UNKNOWN** and list what was checked.

## Required Output Additions

Append the following sections after the main explanation and any required diagrams/tables.

---

## PM Summary

### Business Outcome (Definition of Done)
- What success means from a business perspective
- What must be true in the LF system to consider the process complete
- Whether follow-up processes must be received before “done”

### Supplier Responsibilities (LF)
- **Active responsibilities** (outbound messages, retries, triggers)
- **Passive responsibilities** (receiving callbacks, persisting data, monitoring)

### Customer Impact
- What the customer experiences (or does not experience)
- Expected timing (immediate vs asynchronous)
- Communication implications in case of delay or rejection

### System Capabilities Required (Build Checklist)
- Outbound triggers/APIs required
- Inbound webhook handlers required (by Prüfi)
- Persistence requirements (BO4E objects, states)
- Idempotency requirements (correlation keys, duplicate handling)
- Observability requirements (logs, metrics, alerts)

---

## Ops Runbook Summary

### Operational Risk Points
- Where failures can occur (validation, timing, partner dependency, transport)
- Which actor originates the error (LF, Conuti, NB, MSB)

### Retry Strategy
- What can be retried automatically
- What requires manual intervention
- What must never be retried

### Escalation Policy
- When to escalate to engineering
- When to escalate to external partners (Conuti / NB / MSB)
- Minimum data required for escalation tickets

### Runbook Artifacts (Required)
- Schemas (PI + yaml_output)
- Example messages used (v202510 only)
- EBD files referenced (latest FV)
- Technical diagrams used (PNG)

## Fast Path Guidance

If the user explicitly asks for a high-level overview:
- Provide a minimal explanation
- Include a short PM Summary (1–2 bullets per section)
- Skip detailed runbook tables unless requested
