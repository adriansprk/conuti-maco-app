# Error Resolution Taxonomy (Ops-Ready)

## Purpose

When a process includes negative responses, rejections, or error paths, the assistant must translate them into:
- retryable vs non-retryable outcomes
- concrete ops actions
- escalation guidance
- customer impact awareness

## Hard Rules

- If rejection codes are mentioned, the relevant EBD JSON (latest FV) must be cited.
- If no EBD exists, explicitly state this and limit claims to what is observable in schemas/examples.
- Never guess causes, retryability, or ownership.

## Required Output (When Errors Are In Scope)

Add an **Error Resolution Table**:

| Rejection / Status | Where Observed | Likely Cause (Grounded) | Retryable | Ops Action | Escalation | Customer Impact |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|

## Column Rules

### Rejection / Status
- Prefer explicit EBD codes (E_{code}.json)
- If unavailable, use response status fields with citations

### Where Observed
- Cite inbound/outbound example files (v202510)
- Cite response schema/yaml_output

### Likely Cause
- Only if explicitly derivable from EBD decision logic
- Otherwise mark **UNKNOWN**

### Retryable
- YES only if EBD/docs indicate temporary or time-based conditions
- NO for structural/business conflicts
- UNKNOWN if not explicitly stated

### Ops Action
- Concrete and actionable (resubmit, wait, contact partner, contact customer)
- Must align with verified supplier (LF) responsibilities

### Escalation
- Engineering: internal system/handler issues
- External: Conuti / NB / MSB dependencies
- UNKNOWN if unclear

### Customer Impact
- Delay, failure, manual review, or unknown
- Do not infer timing unless documented

## Default Classification Buckets (When Unclear)

- DATA_MISSING
- TIMING_WINDOW
- BUSINESS_CONFLICT
- PARTNER_DEPENDENCY
- INTERNAL_BUG
- UNKNOWN

Never force a rejection into a bucket without evidence.
